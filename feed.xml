No errors, nothing but it was displaying “running” without doing anything really. The Cloudformation change-set was never created and aft... </summary> </entry> <entry><title>macOS Optimised Battery Charging</title><link href="https://ivanvari.com/macOS-battery-health-and-optimised-charging/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="macOS Optimised Battery Charging" /><published>2022-04-25T22:33:18+02:00</published> <updated>2022-04-25T22:33:18+02:00</updated> <id>https://ivanvari.com/macOS-battery-health-and-optimised-charging/</id> <content src="https://ivanvari.com/macOS-battery-health-and-optimised-charging/" /> <author> <name>Iván Ádám Vári</name> </author> <category term="macOS" /> <summary> I use my Macbook in clamshell mode most of the time. Back in the day with my old Retina Macbook, I disconnected my charger couple of times a week to discharge the battery regularly. This simple practice enabled me to use my Macbook with an external display while conditioning the battery for maximum cell life. My battery started failing around 680 cycles (health 86%) and eventually, it was time ... </summary> </entry> <entry><title>AWS EKS StackSet created cluster access recovery</title><link href="https://ivanvari.com/aws-eks-stackset-cluster-access-recovery/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="AWS EKS StackSet created cluster access recovery" /><published>2019-08-16T14:23:34+02:00</published> <updated>2019-08-16T14:23:34+02:00</updated> <id>https://ivanvari.com/aws-eks-stackset-cluster-access-recovery/</id> <content src="https://ivanvari.com/aws-eks-stackset-cluster-access-recovery/" /> <author> <name>Iván Ádám Vári</name> </author> <category term="AWS" /> <summary> Kubernetes is contagious and nowadays hard to ignore. So we decided to look into EKS to see how it would work for our microservice suite. As of today, there are 2 ways of creating (official) an EKS cluster: eksctl via CLI or point and click through the Web-UI. We have multiple accounts and use services in multiple regions, so I developed a custom CloudFormation template to build our EKS cluste... </summary> </entry> <entry><title>AWS MFA enabled console with automated one time password</title><link href="https://ivanvari.com/aws-console-mfa-1password-otp-automation/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="AWS MFA enabled console with automated one time password" /><published>2019-08-14T23:18:17+02:00</published> <updated>2019-08-14T23:18:17+02:00</updated> <id>https://ivanvari.com/aws-console-mfa-1password-otp-automation/</id> <content src="https://ivanvari.com/aws-console-mfa-1password-otp-automation/" /> <author> <name>Iván Ádám Vári</name> </author> <category term="macOS" /> <summary> Moving to AWS is challenging and fun at the same time. Since our migration progresses well, we have enabled enforced MFA for IAM accounts, that have Administrator access. With 1Password OTP, it is simple to setup and easy to use in the WebUI, but I felt there is room for an improvement for the API calls, awscli commands over my console session so I don’t have to cut and paste every time my ses... </summary> </entry> <entry><title>Solving Poor Network Performance on RHEL and CentOS 7</title><link href="https://ivanvari.com/solving-poor-performance-on-rhel-and-centos-7/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Solving Poor Network Performance on RHEL and CentOS 7" /><published>2017-02-16T17:15:57+01:00</published> <updated>2017-02-16T17:15:57+01:00</updated> <id>https://ivanvari.com/solving-poor-performance-on-rhel-and-centos-7/</id> <content src="https://ivanvari.com/solving-poor-performance-on-rhel-and-centos-7/" /> <author> <name>Iván Ádám Vári</name> </author> <category term="Network" /> <summary> We are building the next generation online marketplace and part of it is a real-time Java application. This application is heavily optimised for its use case, handles zillions of short-lived tcp requests fast. Most of our operations complete quickly (&amp;lt;100ms) and some even more quickly (&amp;lt;500us). Our old application pool is based on CentOS 6 nodes and we are doing considerably well on them... </summary> </entry> </feed>
